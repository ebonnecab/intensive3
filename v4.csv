"So I don't know if this is the right place to post something like this but I would really appreciate some input on a debate that I'm going to be taking part in.

Essentially the motion is that prisons should focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment. With me on the rehabilitation side.

Now this normally wouldn't bother me too much as I agree with the motion however I am a much less experienced and skilled debater than my opponent who is worryingly confident.

We are based in the UK but views from outside the UK would be helpful as well.",So I don't know if this is the right place to post something like this but I would really appreciate some input on a debate that I'm going to be taking part in.Essentially the motion is that prisons should focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment.

"[Photo Requests from Solitary](http://photorequestsfromsolitary.org/) is a participatory project that invites men and women held in long-term solitary confinement in U.S. prisons to request a photograph of anything at all, real or imagined, and then finds a volunteer to make the image. The astonishing range of requests, taken together, provide an archive of the hopes, memories, and interests of people who live in extreme isolation.

On any given day, at least 80,000 people are held in solitary in the United States, most placed there not by a judge or jury, but by prison staff. Some will remain for months, years, or even decades in conditions that have been shown to cause deep and lasting psychological and physiological harm.

The goal of PFRS is to fulfill each request to exact specifications for the person who requested it, with images that—through some combination of form, content, composition, design, and/or sheer commitment—are compelling enough that someone would want to return to them for repeated viewing. (People in solitary are sharply limited in the numbers of photographs they can have, so every image is important.)

In addition to sending completed photographs to the people in prison, PRFS uses the project to provide public education about solitary confinement and support campaigns to limit its use. Working in partnership with local advocates, we tour exhibitions of the request forms and photographs, hold events and discussions, and encourage media coverage on the subject of solitary confinement.

PRFS offers audiences a direct and powerful connection to people in solitary confinement, either by contributing photographs or by simply reading their requests and visualizing the images they have described. Making these often elaborate descriptions into images, which can then be sent back to the people who conceived of them, completes an artistic collaboration that acknowledges the shared creativity and humanity of individuals on both sides of the prison walls.

"So my brother just got locked up again, he violated parole only because he has been having these delusions that someone is stalking him/ out to get him and had a bounty on him. I wanted to believe him at first but his story sounds way to far fetched. Anyway, he is currently locked up and keeps calling me, panicking that other inmates keep cornering him. I know there is nothing I can do but are there any groups that can investigate to make sure that a prisoner is safe and getting mental treatment if needed?

"Hey!  
I’m a student at UC Berkeley and I’m in a class that’s trying to figure out how to fit blockchain technology into the prison reform system. Specifically, we were thinking of adapting it to fight inequality that the bail system contributes to.   
Would anyone be interested in a phone interview for about 30 mins tonight or this weekend about your experience going to the bail process? It’ll be great if you have some understanding of how tech has contributed to social/prison reform but all we’re looking for is your personal experience of how the bail process has affected you in the process, the days afterwards, your family and friends, etc.   
We really appreciate any help we can get. Thank you! ","Hey!

What happens to intersex people in jail/prison?  How is it decided if they will go to male or female facilities? Or is there a third choice I'm not familiar with?  ,What happens to intersex people in jail/prison?  How is it decided if they will go to male or female facilities?

"Hi everyone! 

For an assignment I am looking to compare two jurisdictions (federal, municipal, etc) regarding prison policies that negatively affect incarcerated women. I am thinking along the lines of pre-natal health services, solitary confinement, after-birth parent/child relationships, access to abortion, etc. 
If anyone could point me in the direction of some rather progressive policies that are better than most, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Is there something that's in-between sensory-deprivation solitary confinement and a system where prisoners are allowed to be in the same space but not really interact?

"**It comes down to really 2 things:**

**(1)The environment in the home (kids need a stable and disciplined home)**

**(2)Lack of college education.**

&#x200B;

**HAVE IN MIND:**

**The government does not own anyone** and we must remember the goal is to mainly reform and then use to contribute to the economy.

&#x200B;

**GOALS:**

To reform and **give the tools to fully integrate** to contribute and prevent recidivism and broken homes.

&#x200B;

**(1)Automatic erasure of all misdemeanors after 1 year** after offense and 2 years after offense for most felonies.

The longer you wait to pardon, the more recidivism and victims of crime you create.

&#x200B;

**(2)Eliminate parole, probation, half-way houses**, ankle bracelets and others that contribute to recidivism and cost the state way too much. Once they’ve paid their debt (prison), let them go.

&#x200B;

**(3)Prison sentencing**:

* **No prison for all misdemeanors** (just an overnight jail stay). Instead, we use the same system that's used for child support to automatically **deduct a percentage from their work check for 2 years**.
* Felonies that require less than 5 years do that time but anything that requires 5-15 just do 5 years. 15 1/2 or more just do 15 years. **Sentences can not exceed 15 years**.
* The mission of **prison is to reform to then help integrate** to then have them contribute. It's an investment. The most serious offenders like serial killers, mass shooters, mass rapers, sex traffickers, etc, get life and there's no parole.
* Crimes of survival are given no more than 15 years.

&#x200B;

**(4)Inside prison reform**:

* **If you're doing 5 years or more, you must get your GED (or easier CT version diploma that can be introduced) and a college or trade degree in order to be released**.
* Those who do not cooperate will simply be left in prison until they do.
* **One person per cell**. Never two.
* The whole prison system will revolve around rehabilitation for full integration and correction officer safety.

&#x200B;

**(5)Police reform**:

* **Licenses for all police** that can have points taken off and can even be revoked which will not allow them to be hired by another town if fired by the first one. If you're not professional enough for one town, you're a hazard and a liability (lawsuit) for another.
* **Body cameras for all police officers**. Citizens can access bodycam footage pertaining to their case. This is already being done by NYPD.
* **Business cards for all police** to give to those they have cases with. This is already being done by NYPD.
* **End the 'blue line' of secrecy and lying for one another**. It does not work in the favor of the people who pay their salaries (citizens they swore to protect). It's criminal and promotes criminal behavior and mentalities inside police departments.
* **The top 2 killers of police are traffic stops and domestic cases**.
* **No police pullovers or looking up plates anymore** unless vehicle behavior or condition is a threat to public safety or there's an APB out for vehicle. Tickets can be sent to address if there's a small violation. No need to pull anyone over and risk your life.
* **In domestic cases, both (or all) parties should be arrested** if they insist on the other being arrested. Children will go with relatives. This will end the charades and notion that one can rebel against their partner, provoke a fight and violent response, and then one can call police as a weapon.
* **Police quotas in any form should result in license revocation**, fine, and prison time. Same goes for those officers who assault detained suspects.
* **Infiltrate every police department** and have multiple informants there to keep tabs on all of their activities. Compartmentalize by giving different paper lists to different people. Info can't be hacked since it's on paper and it would be impossible to expose the whole thing since no one has the whole list.
* **Eliminate police raids and only go for the big fish** or terror-related threats. Go after the leaks instead of attacking the water. Have feds dirty their hands and use up their funds.
* **Eliminate Trump administration laws that oppress minorities and that give police more leeway to shoot**. We can't turn neighborhoods into shooting ranges.
* **De-militarize and de-gang police** and keep tabs on the federal training they recieve.
* **Eliminate civil forfeiture** completely. It promotes corruption.
* **Eliminate polygraph tests for police job entrance** which have proven to be unreliable (NYPD, the biggest police force in the US, doesn't use them). Background check, testimonies of character, psychological exam as well as mental health history check shall do. If polygraph tests really worked, we would have perfect police with perfect police conduct.
* **End racial discrimination of gun permits**. They're based on the Constitution, not by the decision of a police chief who bases it off race many times from what I'm told. Going to state police who run a criminal and mental health background check should be enough.
* Killing the black market should be on the agenda and **legalizing firearm ownership more (like we're doing for marijuana) will reduce the black market for firearms which are responsible for the majority of gun-related street homicides**. Preservation of one’s own life or life of a loved one transcends laws of men.

&#x200B;

**(6)Home reform**:

* **Eliminate child support and alimony** which promote financial rewards for breaking up families and encourage single-parent homes who do not and cannot contribute to the economy like two-parent homes can. The damage it does to children is life-long.
* **Marriage licenses should be required in order to receive temporary public assistance**. It will discourage and limit welfare fraud and will encourage two-parent homes who normally don’t need public assistance as much as single-parent homes.
* **Prenups should be automatic by law**. This will encourage two-parent homes.
* **By law, every job available in CT should be on**[ **Indeed.com**](https://indeed.com/) **and all employers in CT must hire from there**. **$15-16 an hour minimum wage**. **Every employment agency works for the state to end unemployment quickly**. **State union for all who work to make it harder to get fired**. **Employers encouraged and rewarded for making mostly full-time positions**. **You’re paid for 40 hours even if you just do 32**. Annuities from NY Life promoted.
* **Eliminate all CT Works centers**. Public assistance is temporary anyways.
* **Respect religious exemptions** and just plain ole ""no"" from parents who do not want to vaccinate their children.
* **Flu shot can not be required for any job**. No one can force something inside your body.
* **Protect families from DCF quotas and legal power to separate them**. De-fund them. If CT is against the inhumanity of Trump separating families at the border, then we should be fired up even more about American families being separated by strangers who just want more funding and just put children in worse homes where they'll more than likely be molested or sold in sex trafficking. Citizens aren't property for the government to threaten you out of your children. All I see DCF doing is taking advantage of minorities inability to afford legal help and taking their children in order to get funding.

&#x200B;

**(7)School reform**:

* Condense high school curriculum.
* **Have students start college or trade degrees in high school**.
* **Job placement before graduation**.
* Driving schools are part of all high schools (start in major cities).
* **Body sculpting/building training should be done 4 days a week** and mandatory in order to graduate.
* **Make it illegal to drop-out of school and not have a high school diploma and college** or trade degree. **Those without either normally turn to crime and welfare**.
* Since high schools are the biggest target for mass shooters and bomb plotters, **metal detectors and bag checks should be at every high school entrance** like they did for Danbury high school which eliminated weapon-related threats and violence.
* **Station 3-4 police officers in every school**. From Elementary to High school.
* **Vaccines are never required** since the other students are vaccinated.
* **Home schooling options are made simpler for parents** through online schooling which **save the state money** by having less students at school.","**It comes down to really 2 things:****(1)The environment in the home (kids need a stable and disciplined home)****(2)Lack of college education.**&#x200B;**HAVE IN MIND:****The government does not own anyone** and we must remember the goal is to mainly reform and then use to contribute to the economy.&#x200B;**GOALS:**To reform and **give the tools to fully integrate** to contribute and prevent recidivism and broken homes.&#x200B;**(1)Automatic erasure of all misdemeanors after 1 year** after offense and 2 years after offense for most felonies.The longer you wait to pardon, the more recidivism and victims of crime you create.&#x200B;**(2)Eliminate parole, probation, half-way houses**, ankle bracelets and others that contribute to recidivism and cost the state way too much.

Never two.* The whole prison system will revolve around rehabilitation for full integration and correction officer safety.&#x200B;**(5)Police reform**:* **Licenses for all police** that can have points taken off and can even be revoked which will not allow them to be hired by another town if fired by the first one. If you're not professional enough for one town, you're a hazard and a liability (lawsuit) for another.* **Body cameras for all police officers**. Citizens can access bodycam footage pertaining to their case. This is already being done by NYPD.* **Business cards for all police** to give to those they have cases with. This is already being done by NYPD.* **End the 'blue line' of secrecy and lying for one another**. It does not work in the favor of the people who pay their salaries (citizens they swore to protect). It's criminal and promotes criminal behavior and mentalities inside police departments.* **The top 2 killers of police are traffic stops and domestic cases**.* **No police pullovers or looking up plates anymore** unless vehicle behavior or condition is a threat to public safety or there's an APB out for vehicle. Tickets can be sent to address if there's a small violation. No need to pull anyone over and risk your life.* **In domestic cases, both (or all) parties should be arrested** if they insist on the other being arrested. Children will go with relatives. This will end the charades and notion that one can rebel against their partner, provoke a fight and violent response, and then one can call police as a weapon.* **Police quotas in any form should result in license revocation**, fine, and prison time. Same goes for those officers who assault detained suspects.* **Infiltrate every police department** and have multiple informants there to keep tabs on all of their activities. Compartmentalize by giving different paper lists to different people. Info can't be hacked since it's on paper and it would be impossible to expose the whole thing since no one has the whole list.* **Eliminate police raids and only go for the big fish** or terror-related threats. Go after the leaks instead of attacking the water. Have feds dirty their hands and use up their funds.* **Eliminate Trump administration laws that oppress minorities and that give police more leeway to shoot**. We can't turn neighborhoods into shooting ranges.* **De-militarize and de-gang police** and keep tabs on the federal training they recieve.* **Eliminate civil forfeiture** completely. It promotes corruption.* **Eliminate polygraph tests for police job entrance** which have proven to be unreliable (NYPD, the biggest police force in the US, doesn't use them). Background check, testimonies of character, psychological exam as well as mental health history check shall do. If polygraph tests really worked, we would have perfect police with perfect police conduct.* **End racial discrimination of gun permits**. They're based on the Constitution, not by the decision of a police chief who bases it off race many times from what I'm told. Going to state police who run a criminal and mental health background check should be enough.* Killing the black market should be on the agenda and **legalizing firearm ownership more (like we're doing for marijuana) will reduce the black market for firearms which are responsible for the majority of gun-related street homicides**. Preservation of one’s own life or life of a loved one transcends laws of men.&#x200B;**(6)Home reform**:* **Eliminate child support and alimony** which promote financial rewards for breaking up families and encourage single-parent homes who do not and cannot contribute to the economy like two-parent homes can. The damage it does to children is life-long.* **Marriage licenses should be required in order to receive temporary public assistance**. It will discourage and limit welfare fraud and will encourage two-parent homes who normally don’t need public assistance as much as single-parent homes.* **Prenups should be automatic by law**. This will encourage two-parent homes.* **By law, every job available in CT should be on**[ **Indeed.com**](https://indeed.com/) **and all employers in CT must hire from there**. **$15-16 an hour minimum wage**. **Every employment agency works for the state to end unemployment quickly**. **State union for all who work to make it harder to get fired**. **Employers encouraged and rewarded for making mostly full-time positions**. **You’re paid for 40 hours even if you just do 32**. Annuities from NY Life promoted.* **Eliminate all CT Works centers**. Public assistance is temporary anyways.* **Respect religious exemptions** and just plain ole ""no"" from parents who do not want to vaccinate their children.* **Flu shot can not be required for any job**. No one can force something inside your body.* **Protect families from DCF quotas and legal power to separate them**. De-fund them. If CT is against the inhumanity of Trump separating families at the border, then we should be fired up even more about American families being separated by strangers who just want more funding and just put children in worse homes where they'll more than likely be molested or sold in sex trafficking. Citizens aren't property for the government to threaten you out of your children. All I see DCF doing is taking advantage of minorities inability to afford legal help and taking their children in order to get funding.&#x200B;**(7)School reform**:* Condense high school curriculum.* **Have students start college or trade degrees in high school**.* **Job placement before graduation**.* Driving schools are part of all high schools (start in major cities).* **Body sculpting/building training should be done 4 days a week** and mandatory in order to graduate.* **Make it illegal to drop-out of school and not have a high school diploma and college** or trade degree. **Those without either normally turn to crime and welfare**.* Since high schools are the biggest target for mass shooters and bomb plotters, **metal detectors and bag checks should be at every high school entrance** like they did for Danbury high school which eliminated weapon-related threats and violence.* **Station 3-4 police officers in every school**. From Elementary to High school.* **Vaccines are never required** since the other students are vaccinated.* **Home schooling options are made simpler for parents** through online schooling which **save the state money** by having less students at school."

"This may seem like an odd question but its one I have been pondering on for awhile for reasons I cannot exactly determine. Regardless here goes. Terry Nichols - the co-conspirator of Timothy McVeigh - committed the Oklahoma City Bombing, because of this Terry Nichols was sentenced to 161 counts of Murder.

&#x200B;

This makes Terry Nichols the most murderous(?) inmate currently imprisoned in America. My question is when Nikolas Cruz (perpetrator of Parkland massacre) is convicted of 17 counts of Murder, what rank among inmates convicted of murder would he be by quantity of counts?

" In 1976, a Florida jury convicted Tommy Zeigler of four murders.

Zeigler continues to maintain his innocence.

He has been trying — for more than two decades — to convince the state of Florida to allow for full DNA testing of the evidence in his case. He says it would help exonerate him.

But the state has refused. Again and again.

A Tampa Bay Times reporter spent 8 years following Zeigler's case.

"Solution is limiting breeding, paying for their college before you have to pay for their prison stay which costs but a fraction of a one year prison stay and eliminating child support, alimony and welfare to promote two-family homes and discourage rebellion, running away with children and rewards for failure which all scar the children for life and create another generation of statistics. Get rid of probation, parole, ankle bracelets, half-way houses, etc (which were all created to help people re-offend) and just give them HEAVY fines that come out of your check (like child support does) for all misdemeanors, 5 years for light felonies, 15 for heavy ones and life for those who are too dangerous for society. Just seen a guy on Youtube do 40 years and be released. What the hell is he going to do after 40 years? 15 should suffice. This new system will cater to punishment by not allowing early release and rehabilitation by giving shorter sentences. Also, automatic criminal record expungements for all misdemeanors after 2 years and ALL felonies (since the most dangerous people to society would get life) after 4 years. The most dangerous people to our society include serial rapers, sex traffickers, mass shooters, people who bomb plot, bank robbers, serial killers, etc. It's a start. New ideas can destroy ghettos like Chicago. The second part is good people taking back towns that were once ghetto and making them useful again with new businesses.

States have to make starting a business really cheap and easy too.","Solution is limiting breeding, paying for their college before you have to pay for their prison stay which costs but a fraction of a one year prison stay and eliminating child support, alimony and welfare to promote two-family homes and discourage rebellion, running away with children and rewards for failure which all scar the children for life and create another generation of statistics.

"My name is John Barrett. I am 23 years old. I have Been reading and writing and observing things for over 10 years. All i wanted to do with my life was provide for my family. Specifically, my mother. A while back I made a huge mistake, in the middle of trying to sell drugs properly, and went to prison. I was 19, and was sentenced to 3 years active time. Of course, being 19, i got into trouble again in prison a quite a few times, trying to survive. So i was sent to solitary confinement, a few times. Once was for 47 days, again for about 35, again for 17 or so (i dont remember that one) and again for 30 something (dont remember). I was supposed to go through a rehabilitation program called ""re-entry"". This program is 6 months long. I never went. This combined with the ammount of times i went to the hole (solitary confinement"", has pretty much rendered me borderline useless. Borderline, meaning i know how to do quite and extensive ammount of things. Cook food, paint, drive, plumb (thats patchy, which is ironic because i learned it in prison.) Serve tables (super sketch), and if all else fails perform physical labor. The problem lies in the fact that my brain is so dysfunctional and i am so riddled with anxiety and perhaps ptsd that i dont know how to turn to, or how. I also live in one of the richest counties in america, and everyone keeps verbally spitting in my face, or even worse, behind my back, because i am a ""criminal"". That topped with how horrible i am at using the internet has literally put my toes over the edge. Because there is a massive ammount of debt pushing me in the small of my back. Somebody show me how to do this, son. Im stuck 🙇💯","My name is John Barrett. I am 23 years old. I have Been reading and writing and observing things for over 10 years.

">District attorneys are not passive players in the politics of crime, sitting idly by awaiting their orders from on high. In states from Pennsylvania to Louisiana to California, district attorneys aggressively, and effectively, lobby against reforms they dislike and for new laws that they do. Louisiana recently adopted an expansive criminal justice reform bill, but the final version was significantly watered down from the original proposal, almost entirely due to aggressive and effective lobbying by the state’s district attorneys. And in Pennsylvania the House of Representatives recently passed a bill (which still languishes in the Senate) reinstating drug-focused mandatory minimums that had been invalidated by the state’s supreme court; despite a majority of voters of all ideological stripes opposing the bill, it passed unanimously thanks to the concerted efforts of the state’s prosecutors.

"As a man who has spent a large percentage of my adult life in and out of jails and prisons in three or four states, I would like to make some observations about the conditions in American prisons and jails.

 I have spent a number or years in prisons in Maryland and Arizona, and quite a few months in jails in Maryland, Arizona, Florida and Georgia counties.

Though I am now disabled, I have done many hours of labor working in jobs doing various jobs from sanitation in the housing units to working in ""factories"". There is a wide range of reimbursements depending on the state and whether it is a county or state facility. Pay has been from nothing, up to, the highest I can remember, $2.65 a day. I believe I can remember some paying ninety cents a day, ten or twenty cents and hour and other amounts all about the same.

The highest pay I can remember was working in the ""factories"" in the Maryland prison system. I can remember there was a ""soap factory"", a ""furniture repair/refinishing factory"", a ""mattress factory"", and a ""print shop"". There were others but I don't remember what they were.

There were jobs like ""Highway Crews"", where you may be cutting grass and brush along side of roads and highways either doing complete maintenance, or touching up where the tractors with the brush hogs couldn't reach. You may just walk along the roads and highways picking up trash.

There were jobs in the kitchen cooking food for the inmates, or, if you were lucky enough, you might land the job working in the officers mess cooking and cleaning for the officers and staff that worked at the prison or jail. This was a desirable job because the officers and staff ate much better quality food and if you worked at that position, so did you,

Working in either kitchen/dining room also gave you the benefit that you could either openly, or sneakily, take food and related items like salt, pepper, and other condiments, back to the living area where there was a huge black market. This allowed you to greatly increase your income. 

You may simple have a sanitation job sweeping, mopping and cleaning the living areas, or another part of the prison or jail. And, like the kitchen jobs, certain location were more desirable than others depending on what supplies were able to be pilfered to sell on the black market.

One of the greatest benefit to having any job was simply being allowed out of your cell or dormitory for the day. Depending on the policies of your facility, you may only get out of you sleeping area/location for as little as one hour or a few hours a day if you don't have an assignment.

 Being incarcerated can also be a very boring time and just having something to do can help you keep sane. Some prisoners may not have a support system on the ""outside"", or like me, their family is ""embarrassed"" that their son/daughter is in jail or prison and won't help even if they can, so that tiny income can make a huge difference in how ""hard"" the time inside can be.

I realize that the institution supplies room and board as well as supplies that are generally needed,  however, if you are to start with the national minimum wage, which is, I believe, currently $7.25 per hour, (40 x $7.25 = $290 a week), subtract an average rent for similar accommodations at,  let's say a rooming house, (which I don't think exist anymore), at $100 per week, ($290 - $100 = $190), and food at what the government says a single adult can live on based on what is given monthly,  $192 per month,  ($192/4 = $48 per week; $190 - $48 = $142), Take out SSI and income taxes at approximately 35%, ($15080 x 35% \~ 5200/52= $101 per week, $142-$101 = $41). and the inmate should get about $41 per month recreational income. This isn't much but the big thing is that,  if an inmate is serving even a short sentence, he has recorded income for the years he is incarcerated and if,  he/she is serving a long sentence, and unfortunately gets out of prison after he turns 65 or if, while incarcerated, becomes disabled whether it be from working, an accident or even just old age, he has paid into the SS machine and is then able to collect SSDI.

 A similar situation is currently affecting me. I was a flooring contractor for a large percentage of my career life and then I ended up in prison for a few different sentences over a number of years, the last being a 6 year sentence. When I was eventually released, I was having knee trouble, and as I went about trying to work as a normal person would, my condition rapidly deteriorated. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with degenerative joint disease, which, though affecting my knees mostly, due to my past abuse of them doing my job as a flooring contractor, could, and would, eventually affect any or all joints in my body. It has since begun to affect my neck and lower back.

 I applied for disability and was approved in an unprecedented three months. However, due to the fact that I didn't have a work history, which, according to SSA guidelines, is a minimum of 10 years, I was to receive the minimum of  $750.00 per month. I don't know about you but can anyone live on $750.00 a month anywhere in this country? I think not. This sets a person up for failure as then they are going to be tempted into repeating their old habits of breaking the law. and end up back in jail/prison again. And don't get me started on the way that a jail will treat someone with medical/physical conditions. That's a whole other article. (Look for it in the near future).","As a man who has spent a large percentage of my adult life in and out of jails and prisons in three or four states, I would like to make some observations about the conditions in American prisons and jails.

"I wrote this to the prison investigators. I can’t take it anymore. 

To: L Correctional Center and whomever else this may concern 
From: 
Date: September 1, 2018
In RE: Sexual Harrasment, Abuse and Inappropriate Behavior in Officers. 

My husband let me know a female officer proposed sexual relations to him and try to engage in further inappropriate talk with him.  He states he had to remind her he was married.  She tried to use his sentence time as a way to encourage him to infringe. 
Months before another officer offered him some companionship to his loneliness and further sexually charged conversation with plans to engage in sexual activity.  Months before that an officer did not even let my husband turn in a work application and tore it to pieces in front of him and threw it as a way to humiliate him further.  Earlier than that he mentioned another inmate was in a long term sexual relationship with an officer which allowed said inmate to get extra privileges at the apogee of their relationship and retaliation when the relationship was on bad terms.  
We just got married.  I’m doing my best to visit my husband every week, support his rehabilitation and communicate with him in an edifying manner so he earns his freedom after paying his debt to society.  However if I have to compete with a corrupt staff who has the power to manipulate and engage in inappropriate relationships with the inmates whose wives and loved ones already know are going through the daily struggle of separation; then you are making it impossible to be there for my husband.   Sooner or later he’s going to break and it will be because of the disgusting harrassment employed by your poorly trained staff with twisted morals and lack of respect.

"TYRO is a new identity for men who want something more. Created out of Ron and Cathy Tijerina’s journey to overcome seemingly impossible odds, TYRO is a character development program focused on the family. Designed to equip individuals with skills they need to be responsible parents and partners, better communicators, reliable employees, and positive role models. (straight rip from their site)

This program has helped so many families across the nation!

TYRO was created out of Ron and Cathy's prison experience.

They have a heart to serve people and families who have been impacted by prison.

""In September of 1991, I was twenty-four years old when I found myself trying to explain to my two and four year old sons why Daddy didn’t come home that day. “Prison” was a new word to define for my sons. A word that toddlers should not even know. yet here I was trying desperately to provide an explanation to them that would make sense without completely robbing them of their innocence. We were so sure that Ron was not going to be convicted of a crime he did not commit we had not even thought about telling our sons anything.

Now as I sat alone on the floor of our house, holding my sobbing, frightened children, I wondered how on earth our young family was going to make it through that night - let alone the next 14-25 years my husband was sentenced.""  - Cathy Tijerina (Another straight rip from their site)

Prison isn't a place for us to throw people who have made mistakes and forget about them.

It's a place for people to go to become better and learn from their mistakes.

TYRO help people understand that.

Teaching them practical ways to reenter their family's lives.

In order to stop people from reoffending we need to show them it's possible.

TYRO helps men get in contact with resources to get employed and/or learn skills.

Skills for high demand jobs - like CDL or welding.

This program really is changing family legacies!
