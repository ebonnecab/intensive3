"I work in the prison system, and I'm torn.","I'm a counselor, currently working at a work release camp run by a private agency. I've been here for about a year, and before that worked as a counselor at the main unit, a medium security men's state prison. When I first started counseling in the prison setting, I had all the hopes in the world. The camp I worked for was ""Re-Entry"" so I assumed the attitudes of staff would be just like mine, lets help these guys turn their lives around, lets be somebody they can trust, lets show them not everybody has given up on them. God was I wrong. Almost immediately it was clear that the only reason the program that I worked in was there was to meet the state's requirement that substance abuse treatment was provided. They sent us inmate's with no history of drug use, pulled them out of work camps and vocational programs, just to piss them off. They called counseling staff ""Hug-a-Thugs"" and treated us as if we were smuggling in drugs up our asses every morning. Where I'm at now, I am the only counselor for the entire work release unit, and have a caseload of 50 inmates. With a caseload that big, there is no way I can actually do any real counseling with them. I work 14 hour days most days just to try and see who I'm supposed to see for a couple of minutes, and they're out the door.Here's why I'm torn. I hate that I work for such a horrible system that treats people like animals. I hate that I have to go along with the unethical and insane rules that the Dept of Corrections sets for me. But at the same time, I don't want to leave because I honestly feel like for some of these people, I'm the absolutely only person they have to talk to, or has told them they are something other than an ""inmate"". I don't know what the point of writing this is. I guess I just wanted to vent and thought this subreddit would have some people who understood my frustrations."

Virginia Prisons Are Failing Society,"Virginia is warehousing inmates and offering little to no rehabilitation. Due to the abolishment of parole and long sentences in Virginia the prisons are overcrowded and unproductive. There is little to no money or effort spent on rehabilitation on inmates, especially those who have more than a year before they are released. In reality most inmates just sit around all day playing cards or watching tv with no rehabilitation whatsoever…and you are paying $30,000 a year per inmate for it. Being an inmate myself I have begged for a job or something productive to do but have not been given anything to occupy my time or pay my debt to society. There is also little to no treatment program for those with mental health or drug addiction issues. More and more are leaving prison with untreated addiction or mental health issues, some directly because of the environment in prison, which leads to recidivism (getting locked back up). People are begging for treatment but being told either they don't meet the right criteria or being put on a waitlist for an “evidence based” addiction course that was meant for people in society not for those behind bars. Oh and the waitlist is about a year long. Good luck dealing with that addiction while you wait in jail to go to prison then wait another year once you get to prison to get basically no help…good old heroin epidemic. The last year of an inmates sentence they are sent to a re-entry sight. Which is were all the rehabilitation is suppose to happen. At this sight an inmate is rushed through programs and classes that should of been going on throughout the inmates entire sentence. The guards, instructors, and counselors, all know it is a joke but they keep the status quo because hey they need that paycheck and way make waves.It cost about $30,00 per inmate per year and that doesn't include the 77 million dollars set aside for the 28 hundred inmates still under old law (those that still get parole pre 1995 era). With less and less money from the federal government to fund the states the tax payer is having to pick up the slack. If there is no rehabilitation which means no protection for society why are they making you pay to warehouse people in prison. Does anybody else see a need for change?"

Prisoners in Mississippi are not allowed to receive any reading materials unless they come from a publisher or other official organization. Many times the facilities are on lockdown and no one is allowed to access the library. So they write to us and request books. We currently are trying to fulfill over 300 requests from just about every facility in the state.We get requests for things like mental health/counseling materials, GED prep books, and legal rights samplers. We also get requests from people on behalf of illiterate or non-English speaking friends who want to educate themselves.We get anywhere from 50 - 100 requests every month. Each package of three books costs between $3 and $5 to ship via USPS. You can donate online through our [website](http://bighousebooksms.org). We're a 501c3, so donations are tax deductible.

"12 Years in Federal Prison for Ecstasy, Oshan’s First Open Letter from Prison","10/30/13Dear Friends & Allies,On October 20th I celebrated my 36th birthday – it was my first birthday incarcerated and I was fairly miserable, lonely and sad. I received many birthday cards and emails but despite having such a loving family and so many supportive friends, I often feel lonely and isolated in here.On November 1st I will have been incarcerated for one full year. I was at the county jail in Oakland for 7 months and I have been at this federal prison outside of Denver, CO for five months.Prison life is much better than county jail time. As I described in my previous open letters, county jail was pretty horrific. Shortly before I left the county jail an older Mexican man in the cell next to mine attempted suicide by smashing his head into the wall. When the guard opened the door, I saw the man laying on the floor with a very large pool of blood expanding around his head. I heard that he had received news that day from his lawyer that his request not to be deported back to Mexico had been denied, and that he attempted to kill himself because he feared certain retribution from drug cartels in Mexico. I share this story to illustrate just one example of of our criminal justice system and the cruel results of our drug and immigration policies.Being transported from county jail was a difficult experience. Were handcuffed to a chain around are waists' so that we couldn't move are hands away from our bodies, with the handcuffs digging into our wrists. The chain around the waist is connected by another chain which is connected to tight shackles around the feet. While we are loaded on and off the airplane, there are officers around with automatic weapons. On my way to the prison I was kept awake for 36 hours and given no food or water for 12+ hours. By the time I arrived at the prison, my whole body was achey and cramped and I had a bad headache and kidney pain from dehydration. Like many aspects of incarceration, it surprised me how cruel and medieval these practices seem.The prison I'm at is considered one of the less violent federal prisons. There are lots of resources and activities to keep busy. The former CEO of Enron and the former Governor of Illinois are incarcerated here. Unfortunately 60%+ of the inmates here are sex-offenders which makes it a challenging environment for me to be in, especially since I was a victim of child abuse as a child. I've been spending time focusing on spirituality, personal growth and education. I've been taking lots of classes including Spanish Language, Touch Typing, MS Office, Retail Business, Novel Writing and Critical Thinking. Soon i'll be starting a business course taught by a local community college. Starting in January, i'll be teaching a 10-week long poetry class focusing on spiritual poetry for 15-20 students, I'm really looking forward to this.There's a craft room here with ceramics, jewelry making, painting, drawing and leather crafts. I've made a few teacups on the pottery wheel and hope to learn how to make a teapot soon. I also plan to make some jewelry. There are computers that allow us very limited access to email (but not internet or websites) and that we can also purchase mp3s from that we can listen to on mp3 played purchased from the commissary. As a professional DJ and music collector i'm very grateful to be able to listen to good music....While this isn't one of the worst prisons and there are plenty of ways to keep busy and learn, I would give up these benefits just to treated with respect and have healthy food to eat. It is extremely hard on my spirit to incarcerated, some of the most challenging aspects of this experience are:- Sadistic, power-tripping inmates with violent, macho attitudes. Being bullied is not fun at all. Prison culture is very toxic and negative and it is a challenge not to be enculturated into convict culture.- Sadistic, power tripping staff members arbitrarily enforcing lots of petty rules. Staff members behave unprofessionally, frequently breaking their own rules. They are not trained to help inmates to become better people and most of them are poor role models for how to be a good human being.- It is difficult living in such a controlled environment with so many rules and limits. We are regularly strip searched or patted down. Movement from one area of the prison to another can only happen at specific times during narrow windows of time. It is painful to be constantly supervised by both staff members and inmates.- There is a shocking mismanagement of the institution. Infrastructure is neglected, scheduling is poor, resources are squandered and policies ignored. One example: all the toilets in the compound were without hand washing soap for the first four months I was here and that was only remedied after the prison received a disciplinary violation from an OSHA inspector. There is a grievance process but its frequently ineffective and many inmates report retaliation from staff for pointing out their errors.- There are few aspects of the prison experience that are effective in improving people's character. Prisons have a high level of recidivism and a negative effect on the character of inmates, breeding and nurturing criminal lifestyles and gangsterism. I have never experiences as much racism, sexism, homophobia and intolerance as I have in prison and this environment fosters these attitudes. For those wanting to initiate positive social and spiritual programs in prison there is a lot of resistance from the administration. Many of whom believe that prisons are just here to punish people and not to rehabilitate them.- I grew up with alternative medicine (chiropractic, massage, acupuncture, teas, herbs, health supplements etc.) and it is sad not to have access to any of this. The medical care they do offer here is terrible. They frequently make dangerous mistakes and people with serious medical conditions can wait months to receive care or be denied treat altogether.- The food is disgusting and unhealthy. I didn't think it would be great but I didn't realize it would be this bad. Budget cuts over the last years have caused a decrease in quality. There is almost no fresh produce. Overcooked vegetables usually come from cans. Beans are undercooked and indigestible. They often give us food that is several months past its expiration date. Many of the foods I consider to be my staples I haven't had since I was locked up a year ago, including avocado, olive oil, kale, quinoa, butternut squash, miso etc.Additional food can be purchased from the commissary but most are the kind if items you would expect to find in a gas station. There are some low quality teabags but I have to drink from a plastic mug that I heat in a microwave. Many people ask if they can send me food and supplements to me but unfortunately they cannot, the only things allowed in from the outside are books and letters. If I could have food send in, I wouldn't be complaining.- It is painful to be kept separate from my friends and family. While I do receive occasional visits,I miss living in the supportive, loving community that I experienced in the Bay Area, surrounded by so many creative, open-minded and evolved individuals. I also feel the lack of gender balance here in this ultra-macho environment with no women.- I long to be in nature, to be able to go to the beach or walk in the woods. Also miss the excitement, diversity, creativity and adventure of city life.- I have so many ideas for creative, business and non-profit projects that I believe would bring more beauty, healing and compassion to the world. It is really frustrating not to be able to put them into practice.While all the above factors make this incredibly challenging and unpleasant experience, I am frequently able to maintain a positive and optimistic outlook. The support I receive from my friends and family as well as the spiritual tools and perspectives that i've learned help me to feel at peace and contented.It makes it a little easier to tolerate the situation because I have hope that I won't have to serve my full sentence due to my legal appeal and also potential reforms to the criminal justice system.I was sentenced to 12 years, 7 months in prison with 5 years of probation. After deductions for time served, good behavior and for completing the drug program (RDAP) I could be released as soon as 8.5 years from now. I would be 44 years old and would be on probation for an additional 5 years, involving probation meetings, drug testing, no alcohol consumption, limits on travel and random, unwarranted searches of my person, property, vehicle, residence and business. To be under state supervision till I am almost 50 years old is a depressing possibility to consider.My appeal is still in it's early stages and will likely be completed sometime in the next 9 months to 2 years. There are 4 possible results for the appeal from worst to best:1. My appeal could be unsuccessful with no positive results.2. Due to legal errors in the way I was sentenced, I could be granted a re-sentencing hearing and hopefully secure a lower sentence.3. Due to the many legal errors in the way my 2nd trial was conducted, I could be granted a new trial. I would likely be released on bail at that point and begin my case at the pretrial stage with the option to go to trial again or accept a (likely fairly low) plea bargain sentence offer.4. The best possibility is that my Motion to Suppress Evidence would be granted appeal due to an illegal search that officers lied about their role in conducting. This would result in my release from custody and strong likelihood that eventually all charges would be dropped and the case would be dismissed.   Friends and family are raising money to pay for my appeal and potential future legal fees. There is currently a crowd-funding campaign which concludes on November 12th. Feel free to make a donation or spread the word by posting to social media or mailing lists. You can find the campaign at www.teanotprison.com.Aside from the appeal there are some good reforms to the criminal justice system in the works that could reduce my sentence considerably. Positive trends in public opinion are being reflected in the policies of the Justice Department and Sentencing Commission and there are several bills in congress that could take years off my sentence if they are approved.- HR2371 Prisoner Incentive Act of 2013 - this bill could take about 3 months off my sentence due to increased good time credit.- HR1695/S619 Justice Safety Valve Act - this bill makes mandatory sentences optional in certain cases. Not sure if it would affect me, but is a great bill regardless.- HR2656 Public Safety Enhancement Act - this is the best bill for me as it could give me the option to do half my sentence under house arrest instead of in prison.- S1410 Smarter Sentencing Act - This bill would half the mandatory minimum in cases like mine from 10 to 5 years. This would not affect me unless it was made retroactive (which the bill below this does).- HR[HR.3382] Smarter Sentencing Act - This would half the mandatory minimum for my case but only if I got re-sentenced and the judge decided to go give me a lower sentence. [retroactive version by Raul Labrador (R) & Bobby Scott (D)    None of these reforms have actually gone into law yet but I am hopeful that the current political climate around budget issues, prison overcrowding and non-violent drug offenders that at least one of these measures will be successful....I believe that all drugs should be decriminalized. Portugal offers a good case study to demonstrate the success of this policy. Since they decriminalized all drugs, the crime rate, violence, HIV infections, overdoses and youth drug use have all decreased. When the drug use is problematic, it should be treated as a health issue not a criminal justice issue. When the drug use in not problematic, it is a non-issue. We need honest, science-based education about the dangers of drug abuse and we need to promote harm reduction strategies to minimize the harms caused by drug use, including disease and overdose prevention, addiction treatment and rehabilitation.The drug war causes more harm than the drugs themselves. It makes worse all the problems it is supposedly trying to fix. There is an overwhelming amount of corruption in all levels of law enforcement as a result of the drug war.Non-violent offenders should not incarcerated at all. I believe that jail and prison should be reserved for societies most dangerous and violent criminals and that most other problems should be resolved by alternate methods of criminal justice. In addition to drug offenders, there are for to many people locked up for far to long for all kinds of offenses. When it is really necessary to isolate people from society, the focus should be on healing and rehabilitation, not on punishment and warehousing human bodies. It is a violent act to lock people up in cages and it has negative effect on individuals, families and communities.The drug war and prison industry are big businesses. Law enforcement, prison guards, private prisons, prison labor industries, criminal justice professionals and even drug cartels all a vested interest in the current policies and they will keep applying pressure to things continuing as they have been.

The Perverse Power of the Prosecutor (democracyjournal.org),">District attorneys are not passive players in the politics of crime, sitting idly by awaiting their orders from on high. In states from Pennsylvania to Louisiana to California, district attorneys aggressively, and effectively, lobby against reforms they dislike and for new laws that they do. Louisiana recently adopted an expansive criminal justice reform bill, but the final version was significantly watered down from the original proposal, almost entirely due to aggressive and effective lobbying by the state’s district attorneys. And in Pennsylvania the House of Representatives recently passed a bill (which still languishes in the Senate) reinstating drug-focused mandatory minimums that had been invalidated by the state’s supreme court; despite a majority of voters of all ideological stripes opposing the bill, it passed unanimously thanks to the concerted efforts of the state’s prosecutors.[https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-perverse-power-of-the-prosecutor/](https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/the-perverse-power-of-the-prosecutor/)It really just blows my mind that  97% of federal cases and 94% of state cases end via plea bargain. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/us/stronger-hand-for-judges-after-rulings-on-plea-deals.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/us/stronger-hand-for-judges-after-rulings-on-plea-deals.html)I have always assumed that, fundamental to being an American, was the right to a trial.

Why Canadian Prisoners Are Participating in the US Prison Strike,
Prisoner Strike Exposes an Age Old American Reliance on Forced Labor,
Legal Slavery; National Prison Strike,"As a man who has spent a large percentage of my adult life in and out of jails and prisons in three or four states, I would like to make some observations about the conditions in American prisons and jails. I have spent a number or years in prisons in Maryland and Arizona, and quite a few months in jails in Maryland, Arizona, Florida and Georgia counties.Though I am now disabled, I have done many hours of labor working in jobs doing various jobs from sanitation in the housing units to working in ""factories"". There is a wide range of reimbursements depending on the state and whether it is a county or state facility. Pay has been from nothing, up to, the highest I can remember, $2.65 a day. I believe I can remember some paying ninety cents a day, ten or twenty cents and hour and other amounts all about the same.The highest pay I can remember was working in the ""factories"" in the Maryland prison system. I can remember there was a ""soap factory"", a ""furniture repair/refinishing factory"", a ""mattress factory"", and a ""print shop"". There were others but I don't remember what they were.There were jobs like ""Highway Crews"", where you may be cutting grass and brush along side of roads and highways either doing complete maintenance, or touching up where the tractors with the brush hogs couldn't reach. You may just walk along the roads and highways picking up trash.There were jobs in the kitchen cooking food for the inmates, or, if you were lucky enough, you might land the job working in the officers mess cooking and cleaning for the officers and staff that worked at the prison or jail. This was a desirable job because the officers and staff ate much better quality food and if you worked at that position, so did you,Working in either kitchen/dining room also gave you the benefit that you could either openly, or sneakily, take food and related items like salt, pepper, and other condiments, back to the living area where there was a huge black market. This allowed you to greatly increase your income. You may simple have a sanitation job sweeping, mopping and cleaning the living areas, or another part of the prison or jail. And, like the kitchen jobs, certain location were more desirable than others depending on what supplies were able to be pilfered to sell on the black market.One of the greatest benefit to having any job was simply being allowed out of your cell or dormitory for the day. Depending on the policies of your facility, you may only get out of you sleeping area/location for as little as one hour or a few hours a day if you don't have an assignment. Being incarcerated can also be a very boring time and just having something to do can help you keep sane. Some prisoners may not have a support system on the ""outside"", or like me, their family is ""embarrassed"" that their son/daughter is in jail or prison and won't help even if they can, so that tiny income can make a huge difference in how ""hard"" the time inside can be.I realize that the institution supplies room and board as well as supplies that are generally needed,  however, if you are to start with the national minimum wage, which is, I believe, currently $7.25 per hour, (40 x $7.25 = $290 a week), subtract an average rent for similar accommodations at,  let's say a rooming house, (which I don't think exist anymore), at $100 per week, ($290 - $100 = $190), and food at what the government says a single adult can live on based on what is given monthly,  $192 per month,  ($192/4 = $48 per week; $190 - $48 = $142), Take out SSI and income taxes at approximately 35%, ($15080 x 35% \~ 5200/52= $101 per week, $142-$101 = $41). and the inmate should get about $41 per month recreational income. This isn't much but the big thing is that,  if an inmate is serving even a short sentence, he has recorded income for the years he is incarcerated and if,  he/she is serving a long sentence, and unfortunately gets out of prison after he turns 65 or if, while incarcerated, becomes disabled whether it be from working, an accident or even just old age, he has paid into the SS machine and is then able to collect SSDI. A similar situation is currently affecting me. I was a flooring contractor for a large percentage of my career life and then I ended up in prison for a few different sentences over a number of years, the last being a 6 year sentence. When I was eventually released, I was having knee trouble, and as I went about trying to work as a normal person would, my condition rapidly deteriorated. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with degenerative joint disease, which, though affecting my knees mostly, due to my past abuse of them doing my job as a flooring contractor, could, and would, eventually affect any or all joints in my body. It has since begun to affect my neck and lower back. I applied for disability and was approved in an unprecedented three months. However, due to the fact that I didn't have a work history, which, according to SSA guidelines, is a minimum of 10 years, I was to receive the minimum of  $750.00 per month. I don't know about you but can anyone live on $750.00 a month anywhere in this country? I think not. This sets a person up for failure as then they are going to be tempted into repeating their old habits of breaking the law. and end up back in jail/prison again. And don't get me started on the way that a jail will treat someone with medical/physical conditions. That's a whole other article. (Look for it in the near future)."

In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government,  as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states). In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.I am a member of the Democratic Party - the largest party on the left, made up of progressive's who seek to join our cause against the extremism of conservatism. We would like you, a member of a movement dedicated to fighting far-right extremism, bigotry, racism, and hatred to help us do the same within our small community. We urge you to join the Democrats, who have uniquely passed legislation in order to better the lives of Americans. **However, there’s still more to do, and we need you to join as a member to elect more Democrats, and prevent the growing alt-right and anarcho-capitalists from overturning much of the progress we’ve achieved.**If you would like to join a great community, and participate in a fun and fairly accurate simulation of government politics, be sure to join us on this [thread] (http://np.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/5ymhfb/join_a_party/) and ask to join the Democrats.

Abuse of Power,"I wrote this to the prison investigators. I can’t take it anymore. To: L Correctional Center and whomever else this may concern From: Date: September 1, 2018In RE: Sexual Harrasment, Abuse and Inappropriate Behavior in Officers. My husband let me know a female officer proposed sexual relations to him and try to engage in further inappropriate talk with him.  He states he had to remind her he was married.  She tried to use his sentence time as a way to encourage him to infringe. Months before another officer offered him some companionship to his loneliness and further sexually charged conversation with plans to engage in sexual activity.  Months before that an officer did not even let my husband turn in a work application and tore it to pieces in front of him and threw it as a way to humiliate him further.  Earlier than that he mentioned another inmate was in a long term sexual relationship with an officer which allowed said inmate to get extra privileges at the apogee of their relationship and retaliation when the relationship was on bad terms.  We just got married.  I’m doing my best to visit my husband every week, support his rehabilitation and communicate with him in an edifying manner so he earns his freedom after paying his debt to society.  However if I have to compete with a corrupt staff who has the power to manipulate and engage in inappropriate relationships with the inmates whose wives and loved ones already know are going through the daily struggle of separation; then you are making it impossible to be there for my husband.   Sooner or later he’s going to break and it will be because of the disgusting harrassment employed by your poorly trained staff with twisted morals and lack of respect.  "

I now live in New Orleans, a few hours from Angola Prison. The prison itself is absurdly abusive and is literally slavery - down to black men who are owned by the state farming cash crops while being watched by armed guards called ""freemen"", until recently presided over by [Burl Cain](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Warden_Burl_Cain_St_Francisville.jpg/1200px-Warden_Burl_Cain_St_Francisville.jpg&imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burl_Cain&h=1499&w=1200&tbnid=dN6UUexXJtQrDM:&tbnh=186&tbnw=148&usg=__6romOwhUKGC8h1us9x5QqtH0P9w=&vet=10ahUKEwiBwMOBtc7WAhUCj1QKHd-KAp8Q_B0IeTAK..i&docid=EPLVI9JziaefBM&itg=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBwMOBtc7WAhUCj1QKHd-KAp8Q_B0IeTAK&ei=1FfQWYGGKYKe0gLflYr4CQ) (can you imagine someone who looks more like they'd love owning people? I can't.)Each year they have a rodeo there that prisoners participate in - they do the rodeo events (untrained of course) and also many sell art/handmade goods. It's a bunch of white, trump supporting Louisianans watching primarily back men risk life and limb for a few bucks (gladiators much?). From my description I obviously wouldn't go for the entertainment of it, but here's the issue: my wife wants to go to see this thing that we kind of can't believe actually happens. Many other people have said that the inmates love this event, that they work all year preparing for it, and work for years to get trusted access to be able to interact with community members. The money mostly goes to them (80% directly to them from purchases) and to resources they use (libraries etc) - and the hundreds of inmates that participate obviously see it as better than the alternatives. That said, I sort of feel that it's disaster tourism - that it's riding a bus through the lower 9 after Katrina, or visiting one of those segregated lunch counters in the 60's (not to protest, but just to have a sandwich at the lunch counter). Am I overthinking this or inflating my own sense of importance here? Is the Angola Rodeo a net positive, or is my attendance just helping perpetuate a disaster of a system?"

The most valuable insight on the American Prison System is from somebody who has experienced it first hand, and I want to be able to include the experiences of a former prisoner instead of throwing together a list of sources who have studied the Prison System objectively. If you or someone you know is interested in answering these questions, please contact me here on reddit and I will send you the questions so that you can type responses and send them back to me for my report.

Caste Away: Mass Incarceration and the Hardening of Economic Inequality,"""Caste Away"" originally appeared as part of the University of California Press's blog series coinciding with this month's American Sociological Association's annual conference: ""Hard Times: The Impact of Economic Inequality on Families and Individuals.""I first met Elizabeth at a drop-in center for poor and homeless women shortly after she was released from prison. Elizabeth’s father was a firefighter. Her mother worked for years at a stable job in a factory. Her parents owned their home in a working-class white community in a Boston suburb, and raised their children with aspirations of college and a middle-class life. By the time Elizabeth came of age America’s economic landscape had changed. Secure jobs that pay good wages were scarce and even though Elizabeth earned an associate’s degree she wasn’t able to do better than a series of unreliable jobs in food service. When a family tragedy (her sister’s illness and eventual death) made her too sad to smile at restaurant patrons she was fired. Broke and depressed, she lost her apartment, began to drink excessively, suffered several assaults, and was arrested and incarcerated on charges of creating a public disturbance and shoplifting. “Free” now for more than five years, she is stigmatized, unemployable, and sick.As wealth and income gaps in the United States have dramatically widened over the past decades, the life paths of rich and poor Americans have diverged to the point in which, I believe, we should consider using the language of “caste” to describe American society. Caste arises when social differences become so significant that individual personalities, preferences, talents and weaknesses become subsumed to stereotypical images of the characteristics of a community or group as a whole – what we often call profiling. Groups are identified in terms of physical differences (real or imagined), inter-group interactions become formalized and limited, group characteristics become infused with moral meanings which justify and enforce differential access to valued resources and occupations, and group characteristics come to be seen as inherent and unchangeable.Elizabeth has helped me understand the workings of caste. She experiences geographic segregation, whether in jail, in homeless shelters or in public housing. She has been arrested for trespassing simply for sitting down and relaxing in neighborhoods not assigned to, in her words, “people like me.” Elizabeth recognizes that there are structural barriers to changing her status, but most days she attributes her position to classic caste-like physical traits: a genetic tendency for alcohol abuse or to PTSD that has “rewired my brain.”Having been raised in a working-class community, Elizabeth is aware of how differently she is treated now that she has lost some of her teeth and acquired the clothes and mannerisms of the untouchable caste. She once told me that people don’t like to sit next to her on public transportation. “They look at me like I smell bad even though I shower every day.” The only non-poor people she has contact with these days are service providers such as therapists and doctors, or law enforcement agents. Her caseworkers berate her for being involved with men who are, as she puts it, “messed up.” But, Elizabeth explains, “no man who is any good is going to want a woman like me.”In the twenty-first century health and wealth are tightly correlated. Poor Americans are sick because the housing they can afford is clustered in environmentally unsound neighborhoods; the jobs they can get involve debilitating physical labor, ongoing exposure to toxic chemicals, or harassment by bosses or customers; the food they can afford is nutritionally unsound; and access to consistent health care (especially dental care) is limited. In a cyclical manner, poor health, and especially visually obvious signs such as rotting teeth, limits the ability to get the kinds of jobs that pay living wages.For Elizabeth, as for many Americans, a prison record sealed her caste membership. She is not alone. By age 23, 49% percent of black men and 16% of black women, 44% of Hispanic men and 18% of Hispanic women, and 38% percent of white men and 20% of white women have been arrested. Poor and low-income Americans are far more likely to be arrested and incarcerated than better off Americans. Over half of the incarcerated population has been diagnosed with a mental health issue and at least 40% suffer from chronic illness. Unhealthy prison conditions partly explain the substandard health profile of Americans involved with the correctional system. But the fact is that people entering prison are already sicker and poorer than other Americans.Elizabeth often says that before her life fell apart she didn’t even know that there are people who live the way she lives now. But of course, caste is not a new phenomenon. In the United States racial categories traditionally have constituted a caste system and African Americans have long experienced segregation, barriers to occupational advancement, and ascription of morally suspect traits and behaviors such as mental illness, cognitive impairment, infectious diseases, hypersexuality, promiscuity, drug use, defective parenting, and childlike dependence on public assistance. The news, then, is not that America is a caste society. Rather, it’s how easy it has become to join the ranks of the caste of the ill, impoverished and criminalized.You can read more about Elizabeth in my new book: Can't Catch a Break: Gender, Jail, Drugs, and the Limits of Personal Responsibility.
